# Description of the dataset
"This dataset consists of measurements of fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction (UC) features on cardiotocograms classified by expert obstetricians.
2126 fetal cardiotocograms (CTGs) were automatically processed and the respective diagnostic features measured. The CTGs were also classified by three expert obstetricians and a consensus classification label assigned to each of them. Classification was both with respect to a morphologic pattern (A, B, C. ...) and to a fetal state (N, S, P). Therefore the dataset can be used either for 10-class or 3-class experiments."

# Additional information
The dataset is freely availabe from the [UCI archive](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/193/cardiotocography) and has been used quite extensively for learning purposes within the ML field (several Kaggle-competitions, e.g. [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/propanon/uci-cardiotocography) and [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshat0007/fetalhr/discussion). It is also subject of an article on ["medium"](https://phuongdelrosario.medium.com/uci-cardiotocography-data-set-fetal-states-classification-part-1-data-summary-and-eda-e0cec8a61eff) as well as of several publications.

Below we summarize the main findings of three of the most recent publications.
